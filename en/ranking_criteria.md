### Akatsuki Ranking Criteria

A map cannot be ranked if it:
- Is not finished
- Breaks the pp system (Such as [Over the top](https://akatsuki.pw/b/1821147?mode=0) or [Louder than steel](https://akatsuki.pw/b/1808605?mode=0))
- Is a BPM edit of an existing map
- Is a re-upload of another submitted or ranked set, or has similar difficulties in the same set with repeated mapping sections
- Forces ScoreV2
- Auto-fails / you are unable to submit a score (check via play testing, donâ€™t assume all 2B maps auto-fail)
- Has excessive break times (~30+ seconds)
- Has an inappropriate background
- Is shorter than 30 seconds (Drain time without DT)
- Is of substantially low quality / a joke map

If you suspect a map is going to be changed / updated frequently wait for the map to be closer to a finished state.

If the map is loved on bancho then regardless of the above (excluding pp exploitation) it is to be ranked.

AR and CS difficulties can be ranked, but the **original** difficulty has priority in ranking.
